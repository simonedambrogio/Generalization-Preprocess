CREATING A REFERENCE IMAGE
  finding best volumes in the timeseries
  roughly aligning and averaging those volumes

PREPARING THE REFERENCE VOLUME
  extracting the brain
  creating a whole-head mask
    bias-correction for the whole head
    calculating brain area per slice
    excluding the neck
    dilating and combining
  extracting slices of the reference image
