CREATING A REFERENCE IMAGE
  finding best volumes in the timeseries
  roughly aligning and averaging those volumes

PREPARING THE REFERENCE VOLUME
  extracting the brain
  creating a whole-head mask
    bias-correction for the whole head
    calculating brain area per slice
    excluding the neck
    dilating and combining
  extracting slices of the reference image

    slice 2
      registration is okay, r-value: -0.6832
      but did not improve beyond the original match, r-value: -0.7108
      trying again with new initialisation parameters
      initialising based on the geometric centre of the images
      initialising based on the image intensities
      initialising based on the previous slice (in acquisition order)
      initialising based on the geometric origin of the images
      trying one last time with smaller registration steps
      registration is consistently poor, running out of options...
      rather than estimating the registration,
      let's simply copy the affine transform from the previous slice (in acquisition order)
